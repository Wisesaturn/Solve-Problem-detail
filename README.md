# Getting Started with Create React App

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### 🤗 Page Update Log (2021-01-03 ~ )
+ 기본 틀 제작 및 HTML 학습 <b>(2021-01-03 ~ 2021-01-04)</b>  
  ✔ <b>HTML, CSS, JS</b>를 다시 복습하는 동안 <b><em>React, Bootstrap, SASS(SCSS)</b></em> 개념을 공부했다. 👀

>>>>>>> f0a5200d69462445102827660829d598b70bebac
+ React 환경에서 사이트 제작 <b>(2021-01-05 ~ )</b>  
   🔸 React 환경 제작 (create-react-app 이용)  
   🔸 SCSS 이용 (npm install node-sass 설치)  
   🔸 git 연결 (gh-pages 패키지 설치)
   + npm install gh-pages --save-dev  
   + homepage 및 scripte에 deploy 명령어 추가  
   + npm run deploy를 통해 배포
   <br>
   ✔ 이 <b>3단계</b>를 통해 최종적으로 <b>React 환경 내 Github 연결</b>을 완료하였다.
   <br>
   ✔ 이 과정을 거치는 동안 <b>'branch', 'local'와 'remote' repository</b> 개념을 여러 번 학습하였다. (⊙ˍ⊙)
